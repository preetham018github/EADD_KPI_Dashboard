# EADD Transformation KPI Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **EADD Transformation KPI Dashboard** was developed as a comprehensive tool to monitor and visualize project performance at the Port Authority of NY & NJ. This dashboard helps stakeholders track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to project schedules, budget vs. actuals, and spending trends. The primary goal was to improve decision-making and enhance project oversight by providing actionable insights into project progress and financials.

### Key Features:
- **Project Performance Tracking**: Visualizes project timelines, including "On Time" and "Delayed" statuses, enabling quicker identification of project bottlenecks and improving overall project delivery.
  
- **Budget vs. Actuals Analysis**: Provides detailed views of project budgets, actual spending, and variances between consultant-driven and in-house projects. This analysis supports more accurate budget forecasting and resource allocation.
  
- **Spending Trends**: Highlights trends in spending across different project categories, allowing stakeholders to evaluate the financial efficiency of both internal teams and external consultants.
  
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: The dashboard integrates data from multiple internal systems, including **SAP**, **PPW**, and **PDPS**, ensuring data accuracy and consistency across all visualizations.

- **Custom DAX Measures**: Developed advanced DAX calculations to track cumulative project counts, milestones, and adherence to a predefined threshold (e.g., 85% for in-house vs. consultant-driven projects).

## Screenshots
